### Hi, I'm Nelson Lee ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer with a background in biological research, healthcare, and fitness. I built my first project "HealthBook" to help patients organize their healthcare data, and I've enjoyed coding ever since. I'm currently looking to get a role in backend development, ideally writing Python or Javascript(Node). I'd especially be interested in working at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
